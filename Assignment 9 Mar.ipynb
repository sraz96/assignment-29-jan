    "1.Normal Approximation: The CLT allows us to approximate the distribution of sample means from any population as a normal distribution. This is extremely useful\n",

    "any systematic bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: Each observation in the sample must be independent of the others. The value of one observation should not be related to the values of other \n",
